# Food Delivery - Web App

## Project Overview
This project is a fully responsive web application designed to meet the needs of both restaurant owners and customers. It encompasses a range of features including user registration and login, food listing, ordering, wish listing, location tracking, secure payments, and order tracking and management. The application is built with a focus on security, employing a hashing algorithm to securely store user, food, and payment data.

## Development Life cycle

### Requirement Analysis, Wireframing, and UI Design
In this phase, a comprehensive analysis of requirements was conducted. Wireframing and UI design were executed using **Figma**, laying the foundation for a robust application.
